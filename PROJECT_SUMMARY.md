# ExtraKeybinds Mod Development Summary

## Project Overview

Developed a Project Zomboid mod called "ExtraKeybinds" that adds custom keybindings for enhanced gameplay functionality. The mod includes a "Read All Books" feature that scans a 3x3 area around the player and their inventory to automatically read all unread books.

## Initial Setup and Structure

### Mod Structure (Build 42)

### Key Files Created/Modified

1. **mod.info files** - Added missing fields (require, requireList, map, serverOnly, clientOnly, library, version, icon)
2. **ExtraKeyBindings.lua** - Consolidated keybind sections into single "[ExtraKeybindsLabel]" group
3. **readall.lua** - Core functionality for scanning and reading books
4. **UI_EN.txt** - Translation labels for UI elements
5. **deploy_mod.bat** - Automated deployment script

## Core Functionality: Read All Books Feature

### Requirements

- Scan player inventory (recursively through containers)
- Scan 3x3 area around player (ground items and containers)
- Only read unread books
- Handle skill books appropriately (don't read if player can't gain info)
- Return books to original locations after reading
- Single keybind for all functionality

### Technical Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Already-Read Book Detection - FIXES IMPLEMENTED, NEEDS TESTING ⚠️

**Problem**: The mod was reading books that the player had already completed.

**Root Cause**: Game API inconsistency between `getFullType()` and `getFullName()` methods.

**Investigation Process**:

- Examined game's core files: `ISReadABook.lua`, `ISLiteratureUI.lua`, `ISInventoryPane.lua`
- Found critical inconsistency in game's API:
  - **Core reading logic** uses `getFullType()` when storing already-read books
  - **Literature UI** incorrectly uses `getFullName()` when checking already-read status
- Analyzed `ISInventoryPane:isLiteratureRead()` method for proper validation logic

**Solutions Tried**:

1. Used `player:getAlreadyReadBook():contains(item:getFullType())`
2. Switched to `player:getAlreadyReadBook():contains(item:getFullName())`
3. Added debug messages to understand method availability
4. **Final Solution**: Used game's own `ISInventoryPane:isLiteratureRead()` logic

**Resolution**:

- **`getFullType()` is the correct method** - used consistently in core game logic
- **`getFullName()` is incorrect** - used only in buggy literature UI code
- Game stores already-read books using `getFullType()` as key, but literature UI checks using `getFullName()`
- Mod now uses the game's own `isLiteratureRead()` method which properly uses `getFullType()`

**Status**: Fixes implemented but not yet tested in-game

#### 2. Ground Item Handling - FIXES IMPLEMENTED, NEEDS TESTING ⚠️

**Problem**: Books on the ground were detected but not being read properly.

**Issue**: `item:getSquare()` method wasn't working reliably for ground items.

**Solution**: Simplified ground item handling by storing the square reference directly during collection, eliminating complex square-finding logic.

**Status**: Fixes implemented but not yet tested in-game

#### 3. Skill Book Validation - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Problem**: Mod was attempting to read skill books the player couldn't gain information from.

**Solution**: Implemented proper skill level checking using `SkillBook` table and `getLvlSkillTrained()` method, including `Illiterate` trait handling.

#### 4. Regular Fiction Books - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Problem**: Mod wasn't reading regular fiction books like "Paperback: 'The Briefcase'".

**Root Cause**: These books have `NumberOfPages < 0` or no `NumberOfPages` property, requiring different validation logic.

**Solution**: Added proper handling for books with negative or missing page counts.

### Final Implementation

#### Key Functions

1. **`isLiteratureRead(playerObj, item)`** - Game's own validation logic

   - Uses `getFullType()` consistently (correct method)
   - Handles modData, printMedia, recipes, skill books
   - Validates skill level requirements
   - Checks already-read status using proper game methods

2. **`isReadableBook(item)`** - Core validation function

   - Uses game's own `isLiteratureRead()` logic
   - Handles illiterate trait (can only read picture books)
   - Validates skill level requirements
   - Checks already-read status using multiple methods

3. **`collectUnreadBooks(inventory, accumulator)`** - Recursive inventory scanning

   - Scans main inventory and all containers
   - Marks items as `isGround = false`

4. **`collectBooksFromSquare(square, accumulator)`** - Ground item scanning

   - Scans items and containers on ground
   - Marks items as `isGround = true` and stores square reference

5. **`ExtraKeybinds_ReadAllUnreadBooks()`** - Main orchestration function
   - Scans 3x3 area around player
   - Scans player inventory
   - Queues appropriate timed actions for each book

#### Book Reading Logic

- **Ground Items**: Pick up → Read → Return to original square
- **Inventory Items**: Transfer to main inventory if needed → Read → Return to original container
- **Skill Books**: Only read if player can gain information (proper skill level)
- **Regular Books**: Only read if not already completed

## Development Process

### Iterative Refinement

1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic inventory scanning only
2. **Added Area Scanning**: 3x3 area around player
3. **Fixed Already-Read Detection**: Multiple attempts with different APIs
4. **Simplified Code**: Reduced from 246 lines to ~120 lines
5. **Added Deployment Automation**: Batch script for easy testing
6. **Resolved API Inconsistency**: Identified and fixed `getFullType()` vs `getFullName()` issue
7. **Improved Drink Water**: Added proper action selection for different item types

### Debugging Approach

- Used `player:Say()` for in-game debug messages
- Analyzed game's core Lua files for proper API usage
- Tested with various book types (skill books, fiction books, magazines)
- Verified against game's own validation logic
- Identified game's internal API inconsistency

### Code Optimization

- Removed redundant `queueReadForItem()` function
- Combined multiple null checks into single lines
- Simplified variable names and structure
- Maintained all functionality while reducing complexity
- Implemented game's own validation methods

## Key Learnings

### Project Zomboid Modding

- Build 42 structure requires both `42/` and `common/` folders
- `mod.info` files need specific fields even if empty
- Keybind registration requires proper group labels
- Game's API can be inconsistent between different systems
- **Critical**: Game has internal inconsistencies in book reading API

### Lua Development

- Extensive null checking required for game objects
- Game's own methods are more reliable than custom implementations
- Debug messages help understand runtime behavior
- Code can be significantly simplified while maintaining functionality
- **Important**: Always verify API usage against game's core files

### Deployment

- Created automated batch script for easy testing
- Mod files need to be copied to specific workshop directory
- Testing cycle requires game restart for Lua changes

## Current Status - FIXES IMPLEMENTED, NEEDS TESTING ⚠️

### ✅ Working Features:

1. **Mod Structure** - Proper Build 42 structure with all required files
2. **Keybind Registration** - Consolidated system with proper group labels
3. **Deployment** - Automated batch script for easy testing
4. **Translations** - UI labels properly configured
5. **Skill Book Validation** - Properly prevents reading books player can't gain info from
6. **Regular Book Handling** - Correctly handles books with negative/missing page counts
7. **Drink Water Functionality** - Original implementation (unchanged)

### ⚠️ Features Needing Testing:

1. **Already-Read Book Detection** - Fixes implemented using game's own `isLiteratureRead()` method
2. **Ground Item Reading** - Fixes implemented by storing square references directly

### Technical Resolution Summary

**The `getFullType()` vs `getFullName()` Issue:**

- **Problem**: Game has internal inconsistency in book reading API
- **Root Cause**: Core reading logic uses `getFullType()`, literature UI uses `getFullName()`
- **Solution**: Use game's own `isLiteratureRead()` method which correctly uses `getFullType()`
- **Status**: Fixes implemented, needs in-game testing

**Ground Item Reading:**

- **Problem**: Complex square-finding logic was unreliable
- **Solution**: Store square reference during collection
- **Status**: Fixes implemented, needs in-game testing

**Note**: Only readall.lua fixes are being worked on. DrinkWater.lua remains unchanged from original implementation.

## File Structure Summary

- **Core Logic**: `readall.lua` (~120 lines) - ⚠️ **Fixes implemented, needs testing**
- **Keybind Registration**: `ExtraKeyBindings.lua` - ✅ Working
- **Mod Metadata**: `mod.info` files with all required fields - ✅ Working
- **Deployment**: `deploy_mod.bat` for automated copying - ✅ Working
- **Translations**: `UI_EN.txt` for UI labels - ✅ Working
- **Drink Water**: `DrinkWater.lua` - ✅ Original implementation (unchanged)

## Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial implementation with basic drink water functionality
- **v1.1**: Added read all books feature with comprehensive fixes for all identified issues

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implemented fixes in-game** to verify they resolve the issues
2. **Verify already-read book detection** works correctly with the new `isLiteratureRead()` implementation
3. **Test ground item reading** to ensure books are properly picked up, read, and returned
4. **Update status to "RESOLVED"** once testing confirms fixes work

**Focus**: Only testing readall.lua fixes. DrinkWater.lua remains unchanged.

The mod has the correct structure and approach with fixes implemented for the identified issues in readall.lua. However, these fixes need to be tested in-game to confirm they actually resolve the problems. The main technical challenge was resolving the game's internal API inconsistency between `getFullType()` and `getFullName()` methods, which has been addressed by using the game's own validation logic.
